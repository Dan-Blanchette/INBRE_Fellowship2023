# INBRE_Fellowship2023
Development of cell segmentation software for Dr. Dianna Mitchell's lab at the University of Idaho. This project  was conducted from May 2023 to July 2023.

# Objectives
- Separate confocal microscope live imaging time series data by specimen and apply segmentation algorithms to quantify microglia cell counts.
- Apply tracking methods for each specimen and flag anomalous events such as cell division and cells entering/exiting the focal plane.

# Methods
- NIS Elements software (Nikon)
- Fijii (Open Source Microscopy Software)
- Sci-kit Image (Open Source Python Library)
- OpenCV (Machine Vision Libary) [Python]
- Spyder (IDE)
- vsCode (IDE)
